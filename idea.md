1) Constitution Clash: When Principles Collide

Thesis. Constitutional AI improves safety by encoding rules, but real-world principles conflict; resolving those conflicts systematically is the real alignment challenge.
Your original contribution. Design a mini-constitution (5–8 principles), craft 20–30 conflict prompts (e.g., privacy vs. helpfulness), and score model responses for consistency, justification quality, and harm/utility trade-off.
Structure.

Background on CAI (mechanics, benefits, known limits)

Taxonomy of principle conflicts (privacy, autonomy, fairness, truthfulness)

Your evaluation: prompts, rubric, results

Remedies: priority schemes, tie-breakers, appeal-to-consequences vs. deontic rules
Artifacts.

Table: principle × conflict type with observed failure modes

Feasibility. Prompts + rubric-based scoring are enough (no training needed).
Why it’s yours. The conflict set, rubric, and analysis come from your judgment.
